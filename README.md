# groovy-katas

Repeatable Groovy exercises to hone your skills

## How do I run these?

Every kata has dedicated folder for itself.
Inside each folder is a `setup.sh` script which sets up a folder to run the exercise in, and a `README.md` file containing the exercise instructions.

To start a kata, `cd` into the exercise directory, run `./setup.sh` and open up the `README.md` for the exercise instructions.

## Where do I start?

That depends. If you're new to Groovy, start off with the `first-steps` exercise, otherwise pick whichever topic you'd like to polish up on.
