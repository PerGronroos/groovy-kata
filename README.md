# groovy-kata
Repeatable Groovy exercises

## how do I run these?

Every kata has a folder for itself. Inside the folder is a `README.md` file containing the instructions of the given kata, and a `setup.sh` file that will setup a folder for the exercise.

So whenever you are ready to do a kata, just go to that kata and run the setup script.

## Where to start

It depends. If you want to do it all in succession, start off by going into the [first steps](first-steps/basic/README.md) folder and read the readme there.
