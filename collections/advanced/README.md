# Collections (advanced)

## Transforming list contents

Define a list containing some names of your friends and family.

Print out the following:
    - a new list containing the names in uppercase
    - a new list containing a Map object (_name: value_) for each original entry

- Run `groovy exercise.groovy`
- Q: Was the output as expected?
- Q: What happens when you add a _null_ value to the list?
- Q: Has the original list been mutated? If so, how can you avoid that?
