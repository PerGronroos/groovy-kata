# Collections (basic)

## Interacting with lists

Define a List variable.

Add the title of three films, shows or songs you like to the list.

Finally, iterate over the list and print out the names of its items.

- Run `groovy exercise.groovy`
- Q: Was the output as expected?
- Q: Did you add your items individually, all at once, or during initialization?
- Q: How did you iterate over the list? Are there any alternative ways?

## Interacting with maps

Define a Map variable.

Add entries for the `title`, `author` and `genre` of your favorite book to the map.

Print the value of your entries.

- Run `groovy exercise.groovy`
- Q: Was the output as expected?
- Q: Did you add your items individually, all at once, or during initialization?
- Q: How did you access the entry values? Are there any alternative ways?
