# Parallelism (basic)

## Parallel closure execution

In the `exercise.groovy` script, you can find a list of closures, run them in parallel.

- Run `groovy exercise.groovy`
- Check the output to verify the closures ran in parallel
- Q: Did you rely on GPars? If so, how would you approach this without it?
