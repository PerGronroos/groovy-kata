# First steps (Basic)

## Hello, world!

Write a line that prints `Hello, world!`.

- Run `groovy script.groovy`
- Q: Was the output as expected?

## Defining variables

First, store three numbers in three different variables.

Then add, subtract, multiply or divide the numbers however you like, store the result in a new variable.

Finally, print the result.

- Run `groovy script.groovy`
- Q: Was the output as expected?
- Q: What types did you use for your variables? Are there any other options?

## Logic paths

Store a number in a variable.

Then, write some code that prints the number if it's lower than 10, and prints `"Whoa, that's too big!"` if it isn't.

- Run `groovy script.groovy`
- Q: Was the output as expected?
- Q: What are some other ways to write such a conditional block? What are their up- and downsides?
