# First steps (Basic)

If you need help remembering the syntax, the [groovy homepage](http://groovy-lang.org/syntax.html) is your friend!

## Hello, world!

Write a line that prints `Hello, world!`.

- Run `groovy exercise.groovy`
- Q: Was the output as expected?

## Defining variables

First, store three numbers in three different variables using the `def`, `int` or `String` keyword.

Then add, subtract, multiply or divide the numbers however you like, store the result in a new variable.

Finally, print the result.

- Run `groovy exercise.groovy`
- Q: What types did you use for your variables? Are there any other options? Did the type change how the code worked?

## Logic paths

Store a number in a variable.

Then, write some code that prints `<number> is less than 10. Ok!` if it's lower than 10.
If the number is 10 or higher, it prints `Whoa, <number> is too big!` instead.

- Run `groovy exercise.groovy`
- Q: Was the output as expected?
- Q: How did you format your resulting strings? When would you use concatenation, `StringBuilder`, variable expansion, ...?
- Q: What are some other ways to write your conditional block? What are their up- and downsides?

## Looping

Print `Hello, world!` twenty times.

- Run `groovy exercise.groovy`
- Q: Was the output as expected?
- Q: Can you think of another way to write your loop?
