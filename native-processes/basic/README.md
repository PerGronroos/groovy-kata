# Native processes (basic)

## Executing a process

Write a script that executes `ls -l` and prints the resulting object.

- Run `groovy exercise.groovy`
- Q: What is the resulting object of the execution?
- Q: What are the differences between using the following:
    - `String.execute()`
    - `List.execute()`
    - `ProcessBuilder`

## Printing process output

Write a script that executes `ls -l` and prints the process output.

- Run `groovy exercise.groovy`
- Assert the output matches that of a self-run `ls -l`
