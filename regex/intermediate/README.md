# Regex (Intermediate)

## Capture groups

Apply the regex in the comments to the `story` string.

Print out the following:
    - a boolean telling if there were any matches
    - the total number of matches
    - the second match, formatted `hh-mm-ss`
    - the total number of matches specifying seconds

- Run `groovy exercise.groovy`
- Assert your outputs are correct

## Replace

Using regex, replace all the timestamps in the `story` string with `about <hh> o' clock`.

Print out the result.

- Run `groovy exercise.groovy`
- Assert your output no logner contains accurate timestamps
